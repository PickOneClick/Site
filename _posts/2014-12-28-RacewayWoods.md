In the winter, Midwest forest preserves are a very bland thing to try and photograph  
There may be something there and I just don't have the eye to see it  
Even though I have lived in the area for years, this is the first time I entered  
Some fun (very hilly) bicycle trails where there use to be a racetrack in the 60's
